## Useful commands

Since you're learning how to use `git`, we want to keep track of useful commands as we work on the project. 



### Git Commands 
```
git clone [url] # Download a project 
git checkout -b [branch name] #  Create a  new branch with `branch_name` 
git status # See the filenames that have changed 
git diff # See the contents difference of the changes 
git add . # Stage all files for a commit 
git commit -m "Commit message here" # Save all changes as a commit 
git push origin [branch_name] # Push all changes to github (origin) 
git pull origin [branch_name] # Update local branches with remote changes 
```

### Bash commands 
```
ls # List contents of directory 
mkdir [folder_name] # Create a folder with name folder_name 
rm -rf [folder_name] # Recursively delete all files in a folder 
subl . # Open sublime to the current directory 
command Z = undo change
command + shift Z = redo change
git log = see all the commits
```
